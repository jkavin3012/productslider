🚀 Showcasing My Interactive E-Commerce Product Page for the Canon EOS R10!
I recently built a responsive product display page with a dynamic image carousel, quantity selector, and clean UI—all from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key Features:

📸 Interactive Image Gallery – Smooth transitions between product views with thumbnail navigation.

🔢 Smart Quantity Control – Enforces valid input ranges (1-5) with intuitive +/- buttons.

⭐ Visual Rating System – Displays star ratings with partial fills for reviews.

🛒 Clean & Modern Layout – Uses CSS Grid & Flexbox for a polished, responsive design.
